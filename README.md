# ochre
Open resources for working with data published from the OCHRE platform.

## Structure
The TEMPLATE repository is the basic structure and files needed to create a splash page for a data-driven OCHRE site.
The template is based on the Tiwanaku project in OCHRE, so you will see images and other details specific to that project.
Replace any and all images with your own images.

## Contents
### Assets
Save your splash images here.

### CSS
Rename the TEMPLATE.css file to your own project name, then update the path in the index.html document %%TEMPLATE.css /
You may edit the css file directly or use the SASS css editing language.
If you opt NOT to use SASS, you can delete the sass directory and the .css.map file in the CSS directory.

### Icons
These files should create useful favicons in browsers and mobile links.

### Images
We include some OCHRE images for branding purposes. We ask that you use these somewhere on the webpage.

### Scripts
The required Bootstrap files are included in this template package so this page may be viewed offline.
Before going live, consider loading Bootstrap and the other scripts using a CDN instead.

## Update fields in the index.html file
The fields and values to change have been marked with two percentage signs %%.
Search for %% and update the information to the desired value.
Add or remove HTML elements as needed.
Add any needed visual assets to the assets directory.
Included near the end of this page is the option to link to a page that serves as a Guide to you data. ODS can host this page if you write it.
Most of the classes used in this document are formatted by the included Bootstrap library.
